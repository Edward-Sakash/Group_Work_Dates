# Birthdays
We will use the `datetime` and the `calendar` modules to do some operations on birthdays.

### Note:
In the whole project, we note that:
* **Birthdate**: The date of birth (in the year of birth).
* **Birthday**: The day and month of birth in the current year.

-------------------------------------------------------
The group is to be divided to 2 subgroups. Some tasks are to be done individually, while the rests are to be divided between the subgroups.

The following table shows how the tasks are to be divided:

|Task       |Assignment           |
|-----------|---------------------|
|[Task 0](TASK_0.md) | Individually |
|[Tasks 1 and 2](TASKS_1_2.md) | Subgroup 1 |
|[Tasks 3 and 4](TASKS_3_4.md) | Subgroup 2 |
|[Tasks 5 and 6](TASKS_5_6.md) | Individually |
|[Tasks 7 and 8](TASKS_7_8.md) | Subgroup 1 |
|[Tasks 9 and 10](TASKS_9_10.md) | Subgroup 2 |

-------------------------------------------
## Main.py
When you have programmed all the tasks. You can run
```
python src/main.py
```
for simple demo.

**Notes**:
- In most tasks, the date format is `"%Y-%m-%d"`. So `"2020-3-1"` and `"2020-03-01"` are both accepted.
